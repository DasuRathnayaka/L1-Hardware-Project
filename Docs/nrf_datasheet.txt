nrf24L01+ Specifications
**Embedded baseband protocol engine(Enhanced ShockBurst)
  - Packet communication
  - manual operation to advanced autonomous protocol operation
  - reduces system cost by handling all the high speed link layer operations

**Use GFSK modulation 
  - it has user configurebale parameters like
      -frequency channel
      -output power,
      -air data rate - 250kbps, 1Mbps, 2Mbps

** Internal volatage regulators - high Power Supply Rejection Ratio(PSRR) and a wide power supply range

**Radio 126 RF channels, Common Rx, Tx interface

**Power - Integrated voltage regulator
        - 1.9 - 3.9V

**Host Interface 
 - 4 SPI pins
 - Max 10Mbps
 - 3 separate 32 bytes TX and RX FIFOs
 - 5V tolerent inputs

**PA - Power Amplifier - Transmission of a signal 
  LNA - Low Noise Amplifier - Sensitive Signal Receiver

We can use this legally in almost all countries

** GFSK - Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying
    
** RF synthesizer - generate a wide range of high frequencies from a single, typically lower,
 reference frequency with an internal PLL.
 The output frequency is controlled by accessing the digital registers in the device through an SPI interface.

** PLL - Phase Locked Loop - 

** FIFO - First in First out 

** It is important to never to keep the nrf is never in TX mode longer than 4ms.
